# ElectronicVotingSystem
A project for Introduction to Cryptography course, an Electronic Voting System which was implemented by Java.
We used ELGAMAL encryption algorithm. In order to make this project independent of any library, I implemented every algorithm. This project involved implementing a prime generator, ELGAMAL encryption algorithm, RSA algorithm and so forth.
This multi-thread voting system can prevent even server from understanding users’ votes, and is based on the protocol that was designed by Hao, Ryan & Zielin ski. Here you can find the definition of the protocol:
